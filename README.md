# Coursera - AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. If you are a developer new to AWS, this is where you can learn to build applications on AWS. Choose the programming language and tools familiar to you, learn about core concepts applicable across any service you end up using, and then go build!

## Week 1

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) (弹性云计算)
- Pay for what you need
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources (按需求交付IT资源) over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Who is using cloud computing?

Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

### What is a Client-Server Model?

In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.

For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.

### Deployment Models for Cloud Computing

The three cloud computing deployment models are cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

- Upfront expense： refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them.
- Variable expense: you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them.
